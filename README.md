# JWT

JWT (json web tokens) learning from scratch.

### `WHY JWT?`

Used to create login, logout session pages so user can stay in his private account.
JWT is more secure than cookie sessions because it works on client side.

### `what is in this project?`

Basically this project is just for JWT learning. There is an array consisting of 2 users sam, john and both of these are users. Sam is admin and john is not. So sam can delete all the accounts if created but john can only delete his account.
